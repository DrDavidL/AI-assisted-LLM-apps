      "speaker": "Patient",
      "content": "It's like a pressure, right here in the center of my chest. Like someone is sitting on me."

      "speaker": "Student",
      "content": "I can understand how frightening that must be, especially with your family history. We're going to take really good care of you. Let me ask some more questions so we can figure out what's going on. Do you have any medical conditions?"
    },
    {
      "turn_number": 16,
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "content": "I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. I was diagnosed with diabetes about three years ago."

    },
    {
      "turn_number": 27,
      "speaker": "Student",
      "content": "No judgment at all — we can talk about that later. Besides your father, does anyone else in your family have heart problems?"
    },

      "turn_number": 28,
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "content": "My mom has high blood pressure but she's doing okay at 78. My brother has high cholesterol too."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing all of that. Given your symptoms — the chest pressure with radiation to your arm and jaw, the sweating, shortness of breath, and your cardiac risk factors — I want to make sure we're thorough. I'd like to do a physical exam and we'll get some tests including an EKG and blood work. Would that be okay?"
    },
    {
      "turn_number": 30,
      "speaker": "Patient",

      "speaker": "Student",
      "content": "I understand your concern. Your symptoms are something we take very seriously, and that's exactly why we want to run these tests — to find out what's going on. We're going to get answers and make sure you're safe. Is there anything else you'd like to tell me or ask before we proceed?"

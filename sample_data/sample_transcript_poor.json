    },

      "turn_number": 2,
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "content": "About three hours ago. I was going up stairs at work and it just hit me."

      "speaker": "Student",
      "content": "Okay. Is it sharp or dull?"
    },

      "turn_number": 4,
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "content": "It's more like a pressure, like someone sitting on my chest. It goes to my left arm and jaw."

    {
      "turn_number": 5,
      "speaker": "Student",
      "content": "Alright. I think this could be a myocardial infarction. We should get a troponin and ECG stat."

    },
    {
      "turn_number": 7,
      "speaker": "Student",
      "content": "Possibly. A myocardial infarction is when blood flow to the heart is blocked. The troponin is a cardiac biomarker that tells us if there's myocardial necrosis. We need to rule out STEMI versus NSTEMI based on the ECG findings."
